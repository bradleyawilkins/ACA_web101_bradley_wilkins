            <h3> My name is Bradley Wilkins and I am new to the Web Development scene! I got into coding and Web Development very recently and have been super interested, and have had a blast learning and coding! At first i attepted to go to college at Texas Tech for Civil Engineering, but soon found out that it was not what i wanted to do. After that I decided to try my hand at working a labor job and found at that working those hard labor jobs is definitely not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I am a super hard worker and once I get determined I never give up! I will work my hardest to make a difference in society and succeed in Web Development!</h3>
